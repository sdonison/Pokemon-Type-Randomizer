# Overview

I wrote this program to learn how to program in Kotlin. Kotlin is built off of Java and is much more streamlined compared to Java.

This is a Pokémon Type Randomizer. Currently, this only supports Pokémon Black and White, but I hope to add support for other Pokémon games in the future. This program allows you to either select one or two Pokémon types (i.e. Fire, Rock, Ground, Water, etc.) or have the system randomly select one or two types for you. Then, it will use those types to generate a list of Pokemon from the Black and White Pokédex that have those types. Right now, the list is currently bugged and doesn't display all the specified Pokemon, but in a future version, I will have this fixed.

My husband and I play a lot of Pokémon games together and a Type Randomizer is one of the ways we'll play the game to make it more challenging. I've created Type Randomizers in the past with other programming languages. Since Kotlin is used for writing mobile apps, I wanted to write the Pokemon Type Randomizer in a language that I could use to create a mobile app on my phone. I plan to do this in the near future.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ as my IDE. 

I used Kotlin as my programming language. I currently don't use any libraries, but in the future, I will use a library to read files, specifically .csv files.
